# jupyter-docker-pymol

Travis CI: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ocramz/jupyter-docker-pymol.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ocramz/jupyter-docker-pymol)

Container-based installation of `PyMol`, with interaction through the browser via `ipymol` and Jupyter notebook (based on `jupyter/notebook`). A convenient and portable way to render pretty pictures of molecules, and much more.

The installation also contains `numpy` and `scipy` among other things, so it can be used for a variety of scientific Python tasks.


## NOTE TO POTENTIAL USERS ##

May 22, 2019. Hi, thanks for checking out this project. If you are interested in using this, you should look at github.com/BioContainers instead, which is a giant repository of dockerized bioinformatics software. I contributed `jupyter-docker-pymol` to that, and it now lives at this address: https://github.com/BioContainers/containers/tree/master/pymol-jupiter . I am not planning to touch this repository (github.com/ocramz/jupyter-docker-pymol) anymore. Thanks and good luck!

## Instructions (setup)


First, note down the IP address of the currently running Docker machine (which is called `dev` in this example) with 

    docker-machine ip dev


1. Download the image from Docker hub :

        docker pull ocramz/jupyter-docker-pymol

   You can see the list of locally available Docker images with the command `docker images`



2. Run the image :
  
        docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 ocramz/jupyter-docker-pymol


3. Point your browser to the IP address of the Docker machine found initially, and port 8888, i.e.

        <docker-machine-ip>:8888

   where `<docker-machine-ip>` usually starts with `192.168.` 

A Jupyter session should appear in the browser at this point. Up and running !

## Instructions (use)


1. Within Jupyter, start a Python 3 document (or just start by modifying the provided [example notebook](https://github.com/ocramz/jupyter-docker-pymol/blob/master/ipymol/iPyMol_example.ipynb))


2. Declare inline figure rendering within Jupyter notebooks and setup the connection to PyMol:

        %pylab inline 

        from ipymol import viewer as pm
        pm.start()


3. Run your PyMol tasks, e.g. :

        pm.do('fetch 3odu; as cartoon; bg white;')
        f1 = pm.show()







## Requirements

* Docker (Windows and OSX users should install the Docker Toolbox : https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/)

* `docker-machine` running in the current shell (setup guide : https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/)



## Notes

This project uses PyMol 1.8.2.0 and Python 3


## Caveat

At present, this setup is intended for local use only (i.e. the Docker image, along with all the computational payload i.e. PyMol and the Python interpreter, is running on the same host that runs the browser). 

There is *NO* authentication to the notebooks and the Jupyter user is `root`.
